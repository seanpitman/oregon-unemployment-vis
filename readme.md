# Horizon Plot of Oregon County and MSA Unemployment since 1990

A reproducible example of an exploration of Oregon county and MSA unemployment data. R code tidies and explores statistical summaries and visualizations of appropriately downloaded file. The code produces a well-polished horizon plot inspired by those created by Jorge Camoes in Excel.

## Getting Started

This section provides a brief overview of the software required to properly run the applet included in this project.

### Prerequisites

1. Required Software
  + R (RStudio recommended)

The R Statistical Software page can be found [here](https://www.r-project.org).

### Procedure

1. Ensure your RStudio working directory is set to the cloned github repository.

2. Open the horizon.R file found in the R folder in RStudio. You will likely have to run the commented code found at the beginning of the file to install the necessary CRAN and git developed packages.

3. Run the code to recreate the plot. Additional code can be found in a comment at the end of the file to test colorblind viewing properties should you desire.
